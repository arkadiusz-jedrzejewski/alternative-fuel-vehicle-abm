This repository contains the C++ implementation of an empirically grounded agent-based model (ABM) designed to study the diffusion of alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs). 
It was used in the paper:

> **Everyone is Different, But Does It Matter?**  
> *The role of heterogeneity in empirically grounded agent-based models of alternative fuel vehicles diffusion*  
> A. Jędrzejewski, A. Kowalska-Pyzalska, J. Pawłowski, K. Sznajd-Weron.
